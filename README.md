# README
I now own a Robomaster EP Core robot. However, I cannot put it together
until my shoulder ball cup gets fixed. I am in horrible backpain down my left
side of my back because of my shoulder. I had a bad fall at the age of 52yrs
and I'm eight long years into Hellish backpain now. I'm going for an ultrasound
as soon as they give me an appointment. As soon as they CAN fix me back to
health, I will assemble this amazing EP Core Robot from dji. So please, please
have patience with me. I might be a bit late to build the machine, but as soon
as I do build it, I will teach it onto others as I have done with the Robomaster
S1 Robot from dji and my Raspberry Pi4. And as well as Python programming
in general. I have added some new Python programs to my Let's Learn Python
together. So please keep my new organization at hand; it may take time to
construct this new EP Core organization. I won't disappoint you in the least bit.

I thank you all so very much for your support just for being here with me.
